# Catch Me If You Can ðŸ˜ˆ  

A silly little game where you chase an image around the screen. That's it. No deeper meaning, no prizes, just pure frustration (and maybe a little fun).

## Why does this exist?  
Honestly, I have no idea. It just felt like a good idea at the time.  

---

## How to "win"?  
Good luck with that.

## Notes  
- If you're reading this, you're already too invested.  
- Have fun (or rage quit, your call).

## Disclaimer  
This game was made purely for fun. No images were harmed in the making of this project.
